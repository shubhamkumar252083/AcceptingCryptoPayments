The Coinbase Commerce API provides two different ways of accepting crypto payments: Coinbase Charges and Coinbase Checkout.

Advantages of Coinbase Charges:-
highly customizable,
ability to programmatically attach metadata


Advantages of Coinbase Checkout:-
works out of the box,
dashboard product management,
embedded checkout.



For most applications, we recommend the Charges API since it can be customized. This outweighs the simplicity that the Checkout API offers. If you're selling a fixed product and customization doesn't play a big role, feel free to use the Checkout API.
